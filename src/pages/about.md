The name's Ziflaj. Aldo Ziflaj.
_ðŸŽ¶ Cue in the Bond musicâ€¦ ðŸŽ¶_

I got into computers in 2008â€”right around the financial crisis. Some say coincidences donâ€™t exist, but for legal reasons, I can neither confirm nor deny any involvement.

With over a decade in software engineering, Iâ€™ve led teams in designing and maintaining complex systems while keeping customer needs in focus. My expertise includes Go, Ruby, and React, but I like exploring new technologies. Iâ€™ve even built a version control system similar to Git ([aziflaj/gogot](https://github.com/aziflaj/gogot)), a database similar to Redis ([aziflaj/caboose](https://github.com/aziflaj/caboose)), and a programming language similar to JavaScript ([aziflaj/PinguL](https://github.com/aziflaj/pingul)) just for fun. I design solid architectures and apply DevOps best practices to build scalable systems.
