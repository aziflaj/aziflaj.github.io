<p>
My first IDE (if I can call it that way) was [Turbo C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C). That really old, DOS-like design seems painful now, but at least it was compiling and that was enough back then. Turbo C is not the best IDE that you can use, it's not even close actually. As far as I know, the most popular IDE now is Eclipse, followed by NetBeans and IntelliJ. I tried all three of them, but IntelliJ is the one I use while development for a plethora of reasons.
</p>

I am not going to talk here about the reasons, mostly because the IDE is simply a matter of choice. Everybody can try them for a while and decide which one is better for their needs. If you are using IntelliJ IDEA just like I am, I am going to present you with some of the [plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/?idea) I added to IntelliJ in order to help during development.


## Front End development
Many people use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for front-end development, and WebStorm is based on IntelliJ IDEA. But WebStorm is front-end-**only** and I want more than just that, so that's one reason why I'm using IntelliJ. 
One of the plugins I use is [AngularJS](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6971?pr=idea), which simply adds support for [AngularJS framework](http://angularjs.org/), my favorite JS framework. Among a lot of nice projects developed with Angular there is [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), the best HTML5 mobile framework. And guess what? There is a [plugin for that](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7689?pr=idea). Also there are a lot of other plugins for [web development](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/category/index?pr=idea&category_id=42), such as [Bootstrap 3](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7572?pr=idea) or [scss-lint](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7530?pr=idea) for SCSS support. Take a look at them and choose which ones you think can be helpful.

##PHP
Just like WebStorm, there is [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), also built upon IntelliJ IDEA. There are a lot of [PHP plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search/index?pr=idea&search=php) but I would like to mention a couple of them. Firstly, the [Laravel plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7532) and [Blade Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7569). They become really helpful while developing a web application using the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) framework. There are also other helpful plugins such as [Symfony2 plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7219?pr=idea), [Google App Engine support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7239?pr=idea) and a lot more. But before using any of the above, you should install the [PHP plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6610?pr=idea). This is the one that adds PHP support to IntelliJ IDEA, which is actually designed for Java (and other JVM languages).
