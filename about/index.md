I am a student of Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of Tirana and also a co-founder of [Things Lab](http://www.thingslab.cc/), the place where you Learn, Make and Share. 

On my free time I play with code and I am mostly focused on Web technologies and Mobile development. My main interest at the moment are Java and JVM technologies, but I'm also experienced in Databases, PHP, Javascript and other web technologies.
You can find my recent work on my GitHub account and also at some blogs where I write, such as [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/aldoziflaj/) or [JavaCodeGeeks](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/author/aldo-ziflaj). Feel free to contact me anytime using the contact links you can find on the hamburger navigation icon on your left.
