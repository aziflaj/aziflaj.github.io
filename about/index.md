<p>
I am a student of Computer Engineering who loves to play with code and also a co-founder of [Things Lab](http://www.thingslab.cc/) the place where you Learn, Make and Share.

On my free time I play with code and I am mostly focused on Web and Mobile development. You can find my code at my [GitHub account](https://github.com/aziflaj/) and also at some blogs [where I write](http://aziflaj.github.io/Hello-World/).
