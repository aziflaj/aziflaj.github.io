I am a student of Computer Engineering who loves to play with code and also a co-founder of <a href="http://www.thingslab.cc/">Things Lab</a>, the place where you Learn, Make and Share. On my free time I play with code and I am mostly focused on Web and Mobile development. You can find my code at my <a href="https://github.com/aziflaj/">GitHub account</a> and also at some blogs <a href="http://aziflaj.github.io/Hello-World/">where I write</>. Feel free to contact me anytime using the contact links you can find on the hamburger navigation icon on your left.
