<p>
Hello, World! This is my first blogpost @ [aziflaj.github.io](aziflaj.github.io). I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) after I read [this post](http://dashohoxha.fs.al/building-technical-blog-site-with-jekyll-and-emacs/) from Dashamir Hoxha. It is simple to set up and its given for free by GitHub (and I <3 GitHub).
</p>

<p>
I will try to write as much as possible about stuff that I like and find interesting, mostly tech-related. It will help me to remember some stuff (for example Vagrant setup, which I always forget) and maybe helps other people too.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see any of my posts online, I usually write programming-related articles at:
* [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/aldoziflaj), where I have been writting for mobile and web development; 
* [Java Code Geeks](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/author/aldo-ziflaj/), where I have been writting about Java development and tried to make examples as practical as I could think;
* [Things Lab blog](http://www.thingslab.cc/blog/), where sometimes I write any article about the activities at Things Lab, the best place where you can Learn, Make and Share in Tirana.
</p>

<p>
So that's it as a first blogpost (I guess). If you have any question or any other thing to say, feel free to [ping me](mailto:aldoziflaj95@gmail.com).
