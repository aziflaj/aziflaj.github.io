<p>
Hello, World! This is my first blogpost @ <a href="http://aziflaj.github.io/">aziflaj.github.io</a>. I decided to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> after I read <a href="http://goo.gl/2TY3e5" target="_blank">this post</a> from Dashamir Hoxha. It is simple to set up and its given for free by GitHub (and I <3 GitHub).
</p>

<p>
I will try to write as much as possible about stuff that I like and find interesting, mostly tech-related. It will help me to remember some stuff (for example Vagrant setup, which I always forget) and maybe helps other people too.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see any of my posts online, I usually write programming-related articles at:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/author/aldoziflaj" target="_blank">Sitepoint</a>, where I have been writting for mobile and web development; </li>
<li> <a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/author/aldo-ziflaj/" target="_blank">Java Code Geeks</a>, where I have been writting about Java development and tried to make examples as practical as I could think; </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.thingslab.cc/blog/" target="_blank">Things Lab blog</a>, where sometimes I write any article about the activities at Things Lab, the best place where you can Learn, Make and Share in Tirana.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
So that's it as a first blogpost (I guess). If you have any question or any other thing to say, feel free to <a hef="mailto:aldoziflaj95@gmail.com">ping me</a>.
