summary:    Vagrant is a very nice provision tool that helps me with web development. I don't want to install every tool on my machine; I want my environment as clean as possible. Vagrant helps me create virtual machines with all the tools required for any project.

It has been almost one year since I firstly heard of <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, and maybe 7-8 months since I firstly used it. Vagrant is a provision tool; it provides you a full development environment with all the tools you require.

You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant">GitHub</a> and after reading through its readme, you will figure out its really simple to set it up. After installing Vagrant, all you have to do is execute this at your tty:

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant init hashicorp/precise32			# or any other virtual system you want
vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}
