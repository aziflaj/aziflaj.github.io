If you've followed me for a while, which most likely is the reason why you're reading
this, you are familiar with [my RLFO newsletter](https://rlfo.substack.com/).
If not, RLFO (Ralph-o) was my **Random Links Found Online** newsletter;
a newsletter on software and engineering and everything
related to it, comprised of articles I found during my usual online scrolling on
different platforms, read, and considered interesting enough to share with others.

## obligatory backstory

It all started on June 2022, when I first decided to keep track of these links and
publish them on LinkedIn, one link per day. I used [Publer](https://publer.io/),
a SaaS I helped build some 5 years before that,
to schedule these links a month in advance, and everyone was happy.
People have approached to me on meetups and mentioned the daily shared links
-- I don't think I had settled on the RLFO name back then -- and how they really
enjoyed reading them. _"Quality material"_ they would call it.

On September 2023 I decided to formalize it into the RLFO newsletter: a weekly collection
of 5 links, one meme, and a few words of wisdom by yours truly, to make the newsletter
funnier and a lighter read. I even set up
[an Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/random.links.found.online) for it,
which I kept for 12 weeks and then decided to stop (more on that later).

The newsletter was written on Substack, scheduled as an email a month in advance,
and also scheduled via Publer to be published on LinkedIn.
The Instagram posts were created on Canva, and scheduled
at the same time as the LinkedIn one, and manually shared as stories. Eventually
I decided to mirror the Substack newsletter on LinkedIn, for better reachability:
Substack sends you an email, LinkedIn sends you a notification on new articles.
Since my main audience was on LinkedIn, that seemed like a good idea.

It wasn't too much work to manage all of it, and I got generally good feedback on
RLFO. I even reached 85 subscribers on Substack, about 600 on LinkedIn, and I don't
remember (nor care tbh) how many Instagram followers. 

Now, on September 2024 -- _which is not the current date for you, but it is for me taking
the decision and writing this_ -- I decided The Big RLFO Experiment is going to end.
I have even written most of the final entry, [adequately titled **RLFO#-1**](https://open.substack.com/pub/rlfo/p/rlfo-1-the-lost-instructional-of?r=1l6ceo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true),
to follow the same numbering style as [the first one](https://rlfo.substack.com/p/rlfo0) --
_or should I say the zeroth one_.

## what went wrong

Scheduling things a month in advance gave me some buffer time to write new
entries and keep discovering new articles. I kept a backlog of articles I found
interesting and once 3-4 of them seemed related to the same topic, I'd put them 
in the same RLFO issue.

Instagram was a bit too much work: once the RLFO issue was written, I had to 
create posts on Canva and make sure the wording wasn't too long, so the image 
was readable. Then I had to remember to share it as a story, which more often than not, I forgot.
Social Media Manager BS, I'm not cut for it. The feedback on Instagram was
lagging. A friend of mine told me that Instagram is not the right platform for RLFO:
the audience is either too inexperienced for that kind of content, or they're not
interested in it. I agreed with her, so I decided to ditch Instagram. For a while I
even considered Reddit, but the Reddit rules were too uptight to fit my schedule.

I was left with Substack and LinkedIn. And initially, the LinkedIn reach
and feedback was good. People seemed to be reading the newsletter but they weren't
clickling on the links, which was the whole point of the newsletter. I wanted to
share interesting articles with people, not just write a newsletter for the sake
of writing a newsletter. I wanted to spark discussions, and there were none.

I noticed a similar pattern with offline meetups: either the meetups disappeared
and weren't being organized anymore, or the audience on the meetups weren't interested
in asking questions or discussing the topics, which is the whole point of a meetup.
I even considered organizing one or two meetups myself, but I didn't have the time
nor the enthusiasm to do it after that. Maybe the audience is not 
interested in these topics, or maybe the topics are too niche and/or
advanced for most people.

To conclude, the reasons why the RLFO is ending are:

- RLFO and it's readers have **skewed interests**: The good ol'
`Apples vs Orangutans` problem. Links I'm sharing are too niche, 
or require too specific skills, or they don't 
show you how to use the newest/fanciest/shiniest JS framework to build a To-Do app.
- The **medium is not the right one**: Substack asks for your email, which most people don't
want to give away. LinkedIn is filled with spam and clickbait articles from
self-proclaimed all-knowing gurus whose main goal is mental masturbation, and
I just can't compete with that.
- Not enough **time and energy**: I have a full-time job, a family, a house to take care of,
and a few other side projects I'm working on. I can't keep up with the newsletter
and the social media BS. I'd rather spend my time on something that brings me joy
and satisfaction, and RLFO is not that thing anymore.

## now what

Nothing. I'm not going to delete Substack, it's still gonna be out there for you to read
or me to reference. I will probably not post on it anymore, there are no items in an
array after the -1th index. I might write a blog post once in a while, and
that's going to be in this blog you're reading right now.
I'm probably not going to stop reading articles, I have a long backlog of interesting links.
I'm just not going to do it in the RLFO format anymore. The experiment is over.
