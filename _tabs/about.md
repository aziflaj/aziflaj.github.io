The name is Ziflaj, Aldo Ziflaj (cue the Bond music)...

I am a Tech Lead @ [Dealfront](https://www.dealfront.com/) working out of Tirana, [Albania](https://www.google.com/search?q=reasons+to+visit+Albania).

My hobby in computers sparked in 2008, coincidentally during the [Financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008). They say coincidences don't really exist and some people are still feeling the consequences of the crisis, so my lawyer advises me to say I am not in any way to accept responsibility about it.

With over a decade of Software engineering experience, I've led teams in designing and maintaining software workflows for various companies, demonstrating leadership skills and a customer-centric approach. My primary technical expertise lies in Go, Ruby, AWS, and React, though I'm no stranger to exploring new languages and frameworks â€” I've even built a Version Control System (like Git), a Database (like Redis), and a Programming Language (like JavaScript) just for fun. I'm passionate about designing robust architectures and implementing DevOps best practices, I specialize in deploying scalable solutions on AWS.
