The name is Ziflaj, Aldo Ziflaj (cue the Bond music)...

I am a Software Engineer @ [Leadfeeder](https://www.leadfeeder.com/) working out of Tirana, [Albania](https://www.google.com/search?q=reasons+to+visit+Albania).

My hobby in computers sparked in 2008, coincidentally during the [Financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008). They say coincidences don't really exist and some people are still feeling the consequences of the crisis, so my lawyer advises me to say I am not in any way to accept responsibility about it.

Many consider me skilled in a multitude of technologies, as you can figure out from this blog of a plethora of unrelated and just-for-fun projects and technologies. My main skillset includes Ruby and Rails, though I sometimes indulge in other lower-level languages such as Golang. I have a sweet spot for software systems at large scale, managing loads of traffic and breaking monoliths into smaller services.
